# Online Shopping Website Project

## Overview

The Online Shopping Website Project is a responsive web application designed to provide users with a convenient online shopping experience. Users can easily browse products, add items to their cart, and manage their shopping with real-time feedback on product prices and the total shopping amount. This project is coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Key Features

- **Product Cart Interaction**: When a user adds a product to the cart, the "Cart" button becomes active, allowing them to access their shopping cart.

- **Real-time Price Updates**: Adding a product to the cart provides users with immediate information on the price of the selected product.

- **Total Shopping Amount**: When users add more than one product to the cart, the website calculates and displays the total shopping amount.

- **Item Removal**: Removing a product from the cart deducts its price from the total shopping amount.

- **Quantity Adjustment**: The cart includes a "+" button to allow users to increase the quantity of the same product.

This project ensures a seamless and user-friendly shopping experience, where users can explore products, receive real-time information, and easily manage their online purchases.
